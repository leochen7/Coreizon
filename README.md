Find cores as you travel towards the horizon

Coreizon is a sidescrolling game programmed in JavaScript.

***Story:
  Cabal is a young boy who is exploring the world. His parents left years ago to
  combat an evil invasion at the Dawn, a great city that crumbled when the invasion began.

  Cabal was raised by his grandparents all his life. Remembering his parents brought back
  fond memories, but also tears, as he wondered when they would return. Many years later,
  he departs his home to go search for his parents while hoping they're still alive.

***Controls:

  A - left
  S - down
  D - right
  Space - jump
  J - attack
  K - heavy attack
  L - parry

***Gameplay:
  Travel the world while clashing with enemies. Utilize attacks and heavy attacks to deal damage,
  parry attacks to reflect damage, and shield to block attacks with the proper timing. 
  
  Kill enemies to obtain corresponding loot drops (wolves drop claws, pelts, meat, etc.) and craft
  armor and weapons with your loot. You can also sell them at nearby towns.
  
  Travel the map and collect "cores" from invader golems to power up your skills. Cores can augment
  your attacks, and make you deal twice the damage, or make your shield reflect damage, or make
  parrying critically strike. You can also augment basic stats in order to increase your damage, health,
  or defensive abilities.
  
***Side facts:
  The map is static and does not change from game to game.
  There is a turn delay so the player cannot change direction instantly.
